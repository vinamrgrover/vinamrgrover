💻 Aspiring Cloud Data Engineer

👨‍🎓 Student

👨‍💻 Tech Stack : AWS | GCP | Python | SQL | NoSQL | Data Modelling | Data Warehousing | Airflow | Spark 

My interests mainly revolve around Data.

I'm an undergrad who spends an average 6-7 hours a day in learning Data Engineering Technologies. 

I have also created some Portfolio Projects that are built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which further involve ETL and ELT Pipelines. 

Apart from this, I really like Solving Hard SQL Problems.
